# npm git install

This repo is used to try if a github address can be installed by npm command like this:

```
npm install --save https://github.com/futurechallenger/npm_git_install.git 
```

And it works!!!

But you have to get these things done:<br />
1. Maybe you have to have an *dist* folder in your repo.
2. You have to have a *package.json* file in your repo, which I forget adding this in the first place.
